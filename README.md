# CABO

### The elusive unicorn card game.

CABO is a card game by Melissa Limes and Mandy Henning that involves memory and manipulation. Be the first to find CABO, the mythical unicorn, by getting as close to him as possible. Numbered cards represent your distance from him. The player closest to CABO at the end of the game wins.

## Rules

### Setup

Shuffle the deck of cards. Deal 4 cards to each player face-down in a line. Place the deck face-down in the center of the table, and place the top card face-up next to the deck to form a discard pile.

Secretly look at your first 2 cards and memorize them (this is the last time players may look at the cards until otherwise instructed). Player cards may not change location. Choose a start player randomly.

### Gameplay

Beginning with the start player, take turns clockwise. On your turn, draw a card from the deck or discard pile, or call CABO.

#### Draw from Deck

If you take the top card from the draw deck, look at it and do one of the following:

1. **Discard it.** If the card has a special ability, you can use it here.
2. **Exchange it.** Choose a card in your hand and exchange it with your new card. Discard the exchanged card and place the new card in its place face-down. No special ability can be used here.

#### Draw from Pile

If you take the top card from the discard pile, you must **exchange it** (see above).

#### Call CABO
If you call CABO, your turn ends. Each other player gets one more turn, and then the round ends.

### Special Abilties

If you draw a card with an ability from the deck, you may place it in the discard pile and use its ability. The abilities:

1. **Peek.** Numbered 7-8. Secretly view one of your own face-down cards.
2. **Spy.** Numbered 9-10. Secretly view a face-down card from any other player.
3. **Swap.** Numbered 11-12. Swap one of your cards with another player's without flipping them over.

### Round End

The round ends when (1) someone calls CABO and each other player takes one more turn, or (2) the deck is depleted. If the game did not end shuffle the cards and replay the round. The scores in the previous round do not count towards the total scoreboard of the game.

### Scoring

Your score for the round is the sum of your remaining cards. However, if you called CABO and have the lowest sum (or are tied for it), you score 0 points. If you called CABO and do not have the lowest sum, you score the sum of your cards plus 10 more points. Each player's score is added to the total scoreboard of the game.

#### Kamikaze

If a player ends the round with exactly two 13s and two 12s, and no other cards, they score 0 points and each other player scores 50 points. The player with the Kamikaze may call CABO.

### Game End

The game ends when one player has more than 100 points or, in this remake, when you choose to end it manually. The player with the lowest score wins. In case of a tie, the tied player with the lowest score in the last round wins.
